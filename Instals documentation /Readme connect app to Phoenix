Connect your app to Phoenix
To collect traces from your application, you must configure an OpenTelemetry TracerProvider to send traces to Phoenix. The register utility from the phoenix.otel module streamlines this process.

Copy
pip install arize-phoenix
Connect your application to your cloud instance using:

Copy
import os
from phoenix.otel import register

# Add Phoenix API Key for tracing
PHOENIX_API_KEY = "ADD YOUR API KEY"
os.environ["PHOENIX_CLIENT_HEADERS"] = f"api_key={PHOENIX_API_KEY}"
os.environ["PHOENIX_COLLECTOR_ENDPOINT"] = "https://app.phoenix.arize.com"

# configure the Phoenix tracer
tracer_provider = register() 
Your app is now connected to Phoenix! Any OpenTelemetry traces you generate will be sent to your Phoenix instance.

Instrument your app and trace a request
Let's generate some of those traces now. We'll use OpenAI in this example, but Phoenix has dozens of other integrations to choose from as well.

First we'll import our instrumentor and the OpenAI package:

Copy
pip install openinference-instrumentation-openai openai
Then enable our OpenAI integration:

Copy
from openinference.instrumentation.openai import OpenAIInstrumentor

OpenAIInstrumentor().instrument(tracer_provider=tracer_provider)
And finally send a request to OpenAI:

Copy
import openai
import os

os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "YOUR OPENAI API KEY"

client = openai.OpenAI()
response = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[{"role": "user", "content": "Write a haiku."}],
)
print(response.choices[0].message.content)
